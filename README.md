YKMediaPlayerKit
================
Painlessly and natively **play** YouTube, Vimeo, and .MP4, .MOV, .MPV, .3GP videos and fetch **thumbnails** on your iOS devices.

### Overview
If you have been playing YouTube and Vimeo videos in a `UIWebView` because it is hard to figure out direct URL to an .MP4 that you can play natively on an iOS device via  `MPMoviePlayerViewController` for superior user experience then `YKMediaPlayerKit` is for you. 

It not only helps you play an online YouTube, Vimeo, and all natively supported formats such as .MP4, .MOV, .MPV, .3GP with a single method call but lets you asynchronously download thumbnail images for the videos too. You can also chose from Low, Medium, or High resolution videos or thumbnails.

Its blocks based and works asynchronously and returns all block callbacks on the main thread.

Play **YouTube** video and fetch its thumbnail.

```objc
NSString *videoLink = @""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hZ98an9wjo";"
YKYouTubeVideo *youTubeVideo = [[YKYouTubeVideo alloc] initWithContent:[NSURL URLWithString:videoLink]];
    
//Fetch thumbnail
[youTubeVideo parseWithCompletion:^(NSError *error) {
    [youTubeVideo thumbImage:YKQualityLow completion:^(UIImage *thumbImage, NSError *error) {
        //Set thumbImage to UIImageView here
    }];
}];
    
//Then play (make sure that you have called parseWithCompletion before calling this method)
[youTubeVideo play:YKQualityHigh];
```    

Exactly the same for **Vimeo** videos.

```objc
NSString *videoLink = @"http://vimeo.com/42893621";
YKVimeoVideo *vimeoVideo = [[YKVimeoVideo alloc] initWithContent:[NSURL URLWithString:videoLink]];
    
[vimeoVideo parseWithCompletion:^(NSError *error) {
    [vimeoVideo thumbImage:YKQualityLow completion:^(UIImage *thumbImage, NSError *error) {
        //Set thumbImage to UIImageView here
    }];
}];
    
//Then play (make sure that you have called parseWithCompletion before calling this method)
[vimeoVideo play:YKQualityHigh];
```

 Finaly playing and fetching thumbnails from an iOS supported native video format such as **.MP4, .MOV, .MPV, .3GP**
 
```objc
NSString *videoLink = @"http://download.wavetlan.com/SVV/Media/HTTP/BlackBerry.mov";
YKDirectVideo *directVideo = [[YKDirectVideo alloc] initWithContent:[NSURL URLWithString:videoLink]];
    
[directVideo thumbImage:YKQualityLow completion:^(UIImage *thumbImage, NSError *error) {
    //Set thumbImage to UIImageView here
}];
    
//Then play 
[directVideo play:YKQualityHigh];
```

### How To Setup
